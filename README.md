# My Website

Since this is a GitHub profile, I tried my best to create a simple yet fun personal website that I can use as my portfolio. 
This site was built in Bootstrap 5 and CSS 3. It is responsive and I've tested browsing it using different displays and resolutions.

## Technologies

I made use of some elements from Bootstrap and CSS to display the following:
- Modals
- Navigation Bar
- Buttons
- Standard divs and rows
- Basic animation (hover/active button states/etc.)

I took a few resources from third-party sources and used CDN

## Projects

- ongoing
